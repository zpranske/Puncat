Instructions
********************************************************************************************************************
0. Run Puncat quantification macros, saving the "Measure" file for ROI features and the "Summary" file for particle detection features for each one. (Note: in Puncat v2.4 and later this should be done automatically.)
1. Create 3 new excel files and name them "Combined_Measures", "Combined_Summaries", and "Final Analysis"
2. Go to the folder with your Puncat macro-generated files and make sure they are sorted by name.
3. In each Combined excel file, paste and run mergeFiles macro. Select all relevant excel files and press enter.
4. Create a new tab at the end and name it "Combined Summary"/"Combined Measures" or something.
5. Find the Combined_Measures or Combined_Summary Excel file from previous analyis (e.g. in Zach's folder in                 paradis-lab drive under zpranske\project analysis\ZP_04 analysis 2022-09-19)
6. Go to Data -> Get Data -> Launch Power Query Editor
7. Copy the query called "summary", "measure", or similar in the left-hand panel
8. In new Excel file, again go to Data -> Get Data -> Launch Power Query Editor
9. Paste the query into the left-hand panel of the Power Query Editor. You will see an "incorrect file path" type error.
10. Change the file path to that of the measure or summary folder in TWO places
        1) Click the measure or summary query in the left panel, select Advanced Editor in the top bar, and change 	the source in line 1 to the correct path
	2) Repeat this with the Sample File in the left panel
11. Hit Close & Load to run the Power Query. This should aggregate and filter all the sheets.
12. Move the newly-created Combined Summary/Combined Measures tab to beginning if desired.
13. Copy both of the combined sheets into the "Final Analysis"
